## Technical Stack

### Backend Technologies
- **Java 21**: Virtual threads for async operations, pattern matching, records
- **Spring Boot 3.2+**: Web framework, dependency injection
- **Spring AI**: LLM integration and function calling
- **Docker**: Containerization and deployment
- **MCP Protocol**: Extensible server communication

### Key Java 21 Features Leveraged
```java
// Virtual Threads for long-running operations
@Async
@EnableVirtualThreads
public CompletableFuture<DeploymentResult> handleDeployment(String command) {
    // Non-blocking infrastructure operations
}

// Pattern Matching for MCP message handling
public String handleMcpResponse(McpMessage message) {
    return switch (message) {
        case SuccessMessage(var content) -> processSuccess(content);
        case ErrorMessage(var error) -> handleError(error);
        case ProgressMessage(var status) -> updateProgress(status);
    };
}
```

### Architecture Benefits
- **Scalability**: Virtual threads handle thousands of concurrent operations
- **Extensibility**: MCP protocol allows pluggable functionality
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns, modern Java features
- **Performance**: Non-blocking I/O for infrastructure operations
